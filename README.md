# Sentiment-Analysis-Comparison

## Description

This repository provides a generic framework for implementing multiple sentiment analysis
comparison methods and provides a summary for the same. Additional methods can also
be easily implemented by extending the current framework.

## How to Use?

Simply by running `main.py`, one can run all the implemented sentiment analysis methods.

## How to Extend?

One can add new sentiment analysis methods by creating a new class, preferably in the format 
`using%`, with `%` standing for a generic class. This must implement a `sentiment` method
which takes in a multi-line string and returns a list of sentiment scores between -1 and +1.
